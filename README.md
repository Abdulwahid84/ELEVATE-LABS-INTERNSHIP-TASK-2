# ELEVATE-LABS-INTERNSHIP-TASK-2
📊 Task 2: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
🎯 Objective:
Gain a deeper understanding of the dataset through descriptive statistics and visual exploration.

🛠️ Tools Used:
Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly

🔍 Features Explored
Generated summary statistics including mean, median, standard deviation, and range for all numeric features.

Created histograms and boxplots to examine the distribution and spread of numeric variables.

Visualized feature relationships using pairplots and a correlation matrix heatmap.

Identified patterns, trends, and anomalies within the data using visual cues.

Made feature-level inferences to support further analysis and modeling.

🧠 Key Findings: Patterns, Trends, and Anomalies
Skewed distributions observed in several numeric features, indicating the need for transformation (e.g., cholesterol, fasting blood sugar).

Outliers detected through boxplots in variables such as resting blood pressure and cholesterol levels.

Strong correlations found between features like thalach (maximum heart rate) and age, as well as between cp (chest pain type) and the target variable.

Certain features show distinct clusters or separation, indicating their potential importance in classification models.
