# ELEVATE-LABS-INTERNSHIP-TASK-2
📊 Task 2: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
🎯 Objective:
Gain a deeper understanding of the dataset through descriptive statistics and visual exploration.

🛠️ Tools Used:
Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly

🔍 Features Explored
➤ Generated summary statistics (mean, median, std, min, max) for all numeric features
➤ Created histograms to examine the distribution of individual variables
➤ Used boxplots to identify spread, central tendency, and outliers
➤ Plotted pairplots and correlation matrix to explore relationships between features
➤ Extracted initial insights and feature-level observations from visual patterns

🧠 Key Findings: Patterns, Trends, and Anomalies
➤ Skewed distributions were noted in several features (e.g., chol, fbs), indicating possible need for normalization or transformation
➤ Outliers were visible in boxplots, especially for trestbps (resting blood pressure) and chol (serum cholesterol)
➤ High correlations observed between some features in the heatmap (e.g., cp and target, thalach and age)
➤ Certain variables showed distinct separation or grouping, which could aid in classification (e.g., chest pain type, thalassemia)
